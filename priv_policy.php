<h3>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h3>
<p>The School is committed to protecting the privacy and information it collects from its community. This policy explains how The  School collects and handles information it receives from applicants and their families, students and their families, alumni, employees (including applicants for employment) and others who interact with The  School or its website. Other than IP addresses and traffic information collected described below, we do not collect personally identifying information on our website unless you choose to provide such information to us.</p>

<p>This policy sets forth the type of information we collect, how it is stored and used, and the rights and options you may have with respect to your personal information.</p>

<h2>What Personal information We Collect; How and When We Collect It</h2>

<p>Our goal is to collect the minimum amount of information necessary - whether from applicants, enrolled students, alumni, employees, or contractors.</p>

<p>We collect information you provide us. A person&rsquo;s interaction with The  School occurs during the admissions process, during matriculation (and throughout a student&rsquo;s enrollment at The  School), and as alumni. We also collect information from applicants for employment as well as employees and contractors of the school.</p>

<p>It is important to the School to protect the privacy of young children who may use our website. The School does not knowingly solicit or collect the personal information of children under the age of 13 on this website. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to submit an inquiry form or application to the School. Parents or legal guardians of a child under the age of 13 must complete the inquiry form and consent to the submission of an application to the School.</p>

<h2>Usage Information, Site Activity and Location Information</h2>

Usage Information helps us understand trends in our users&rsquo; needs and improve our website and its functionality. We also may use Usage Information for general marketing purposes. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Usage Information, and we may share Usage Information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand your needs and improve our website.

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>

<p>We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We may also use Web beacons (a file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the experience of the site and services we provide, such as pre-populating your username for easier login, to allow user-specific messaging or to permit user-specific advertising. We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. At this time, the school does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking, including &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals. You can remove persistent cookies and change your privacy preferences by following directions provided in your Internet browser&rsquo;s &quot;help&quot; directory. However, certain features of the site or services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our third party providers may use their own cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.</p>

<h2>Admissions:</h2>

<p>It is expected that information shared with The School during the admission process is given with the consent of a parent or guardian. The school does not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 18 without the consent of a parent or guardian.</p>

<p>During the admissions process, personal information will be collected and stored about the applicant and family for the purposes of evaluating the applicant. The  School also will use the information for communicating with the family during the admissions process.</p>

<p>Personal information about applicants, their parents/guardians and siblings will be collected via our website (the Inquiry Form) as well as by The Standard Application Online administered by the Enrollment Management Association or other similar common applications administered by a third party. Additional information may be collected by the admissions office via various interviews, phone calls, references, and emails.</p>

<p>Types of personal information collected include names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, gender, dates of birth, race, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, educational history, and legacy status. Further, we collect information about the student&rsquo;s academic and disciplinary history, athletic, and extra-curricular records and interests, and possibly financial information (to process financial aid requests). Additional information regarding the applicant&rsquo;s parents or guardians such as employment and marital status also will be collected.</p>

<p>As part of the admissions process, the school also may gather or receive information from other sources regarding medical/educational records, standardized tests, and other evaluative material. The types of information we collect in these cases may be specific to the individual.</p>

<p>We receive and process such personal information pursuant to your agreements with such third-party service providers, and in furtherance of your agreement with us concerning your application and matriculation and pursuant to our legitimate interests in assessing your application. For information on the privacy practices of such third parties, please consult your agreements with them and their own privacy policies.</p>

<p>You are required to provide this information if you would like to apply to or be enrolled at The  School. Without this information, The  School cannot process a student&rsquo;s application or enroll them. To the extent that any requested personal information is not necessary for the performance of The  School&rsquo;s agreements and policies, such requests will be separately identified and the appropriate consent obtained.</p>

<p>Applicant information is kept permanently.</p>

<h2>Matriculation:</h2>

<p>It is expected that information shared with The  School during a student&rsquo;s enrollment is given with the consent of a parent or guardian. The school does not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 18 without the consent of a parent or guardian.</p>

<p>Once enrolled, The  School continues to collect and process personal information for the purposes of caring for and educating the student. The personal information is used to keep you informed about the school and to offer you access to school services. Personal information also will be collected, created and stored (about the student and family) for the purposes of tracking student progress at The  School.</p>

<p>The information collected for enrolled students and their families includes names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, gender and dates of birth. Passport information or other identification number issued by the government to verify identity also may be collected. Health and medical information, including health insurance policy and subscriber identification numbers, regarding the student is collected to ensure their well-being while on campus and for medical treatment purposes. Further, we collect information about the enrolled student&rsquo;s academic, athletic, and extra-curricular records and interests, and possibly financial information. Information about performance (classes, co-curricular activities, etc.) and images of the student engaged in academic, athletic, and extra-curricular activities also may be collected and maintained. We may post information about performance and images of the student on the internet and in publications.</p>

<p>The  School may gather or receive information from other sources such as testing agencies (including, medical/educational, standardized tests, etc.). The types of information we collect in these cases may be specific to the individual. We receive and process such information pursuant to your agreements with such third-party service providers, and in furtherance of your agreements with us concerning your matriculation. For information on the privacy practices of such third parties, please consult your agreements with them and their individual policies.</p>

<p>This information collection is required if one wants to be enrolled at The  School. To the extent that any requested personal information is not necessary for the performance of The  School&rsquo;s agreements and policies, such requests will be separately identified and the appropriate consent obtained.</p>

<p>Student records are kept permanently.</p>

<h2>Alumni and Friends:</h2>

<p>Alumni, friends and parents are lifelong members of The  School community. The Development Office of the  School is dedicated to keeping our alumni, friends and parents (past and present) connected to the school.</p>

<p>Types of information collected include name, address, phone number, email, gender, date of birth, employment, gifts received, and events attended. Credit card numbers are collected and used only for donation or payment processing through an encrypted, secure, third party processing system, and are not retained for other purposes.</p>

<p>The information we collect is used for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>

<h2>Applicants for Employment, Employees and Contractors:</h2>

<p> School collects information from applicants for employment, employees and contractors of the school. The school uses an employment application to collect personal information such as biographical information, gender, date of birth, employment history, and employment/personal references on all applicants for employment. This information becomes part of the employee&rsquo;s file once hired.  School also conducts extensive criminal background checks through fingerprinting and if applicable, a credit report, on its employees. Upon hire and throughout employment at the school, the employee may provide additional information to the school such as bank information, social security numbers or other governmental identification number commonly used to verify identity, passport information, biometric information for time-keeping purposes, health and medical information, including health insurance policy and subscriber identification numbers, beneficiary and dependent information, and other information related to such employment. The school collects EIN or social security numbers from contractors and may collect bank information for payment purposes. Certain contractors with direct, unsupervised access to students will need to provide personal information such as biographical information, date of birth, employment history, and employment/personal references. The school also will conduct criminal background checks through fingerprinting of such contractors with direct, unsupervised access to students.</p>

<h2>Email and Web Inquiries:</h2>

<p>You also may send us personally identifying information, for example, in an email message containing a question or comment, or by completing a web form that provides us with this information. We use personally identifying information from these communications primarily to respond to you. We may forward your correspondence to school representatives who are better able to answer your questions. We may also use your email to contact you in the future about our programs that we deem may be of interest to you. We do not share your name or email address with any third parties.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Your Information:</h2>

<p>We may disclose your information pursuant to legal requirements and to <strong>comply with our school rules and policies. </strong>We also may share your information with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to an investigation or alleged illegal activity;</li>
	<li>Third parties that provide a valid subpoena or court order; or</li>
	<li>Third parties as requested or authorized by you (or your parent or guardian).</li>
</ul>

<p>We also may share your information with third party vendors providing services to us in our operations. The  School uses cloud-based software to efficiently assist the school in its operations. Most information, including personal information, is processed and/or stored in these systems. These cloud-based software providers also have their own security policies, terms of use and privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information:</h2>

<h3>Information Access</h3>

<p>You may request confirmation of whether or not The  School is processing personal information about you. If so, you have the right to see or obtain a copy of that information and to learn: for what purpose(s) we are processing that information; the categories of information; the identity of those who receive the information; if we receive personal information about you from other sources, any available information about those sources; and how long we keep the information or, if the period is not determined, the factors that we use to determine that period.</p>

<h3>Correction and Completion</h3>

<p>You have the right to request correction of personal information that you believe is inaccurate. Where you believe the information is incomplete, you have the right to complete the information, including by supplementing the information with a statement.</p>

<h3>Right of Erasure or &ldquo;To be Forgotten&rdquo;</h3>

<p>You have the right to request that The  School permanently delete your personal information when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>we no longer need your information for the purposes for which it was collected;</li>
	<li>we have been processing the particular information based only on your consent, you withdraw your consent, and there is no other legal ground for us to continue processing;</li>
	<li>you successfully object to the processing of certain information (see &ldquo;Objection&rdquo; below);</li>
	<li>the information has been unlawfully processed; or</li>
	<li>erasure is required by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>This right will not apply where continued processing of your information is necessary for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the exercise of the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
	<li>compliance with applicable law;</li>
	<li>performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in The  School;</li>
	<li>ensuring the functionality and stability of said system;</li>
	<li>for reasons of public health;</li>
	<li>certain types of archiving that is in the public interest, scientific or historical research or statistical purposes; or</li>
	<li>the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Restriction on Processing</h3>

<p>You have the right to request that The  School stop or restrict the processing of your personal information where:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you are contesting the accuracy of your personal information, in which case processing could be restricted for the period of time necessary for us to determine the accuracy of the information;</li>
	<li>the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal information and request instead that processing be restricted;</li>
	<li>we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing in question, but you need the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>
	<li>you object to the processing of certain information (see &ldquo;Objection&rdquo; below), in which case processing could be restricted for the period of time necessary for us to determine our response to the objection.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you successfully exercise this right of restriction, we will process the information in question only: (i) where we have your consent to do so; (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; (iii) for the protection of the rights of another person; or (iv) for reasons of important public interest. In the event that any such restriction is lifted and processing resumes, we will inform you beforehand.</p>

<h3>Limited Information Portability</h3>

<p>With respect to personal information that we have received directly from you (as opposed to information that we may receive about you from sources other than you), you have a right to request and receive such information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit such information to another entity without interference from us.</p>

<p>Please note that this right of portability applies only in limited circumstances, such as: where we are processing personal information on the basis of your consent or pursuant to our contractual agreements with you, and the processing is carried out by automated means. If you request that we transmit your information directly to another individual or entity, we will comply where it is feasible to do so.</p>

<h3>Objection</h3>

<p>You may object to processing of your personal information that is based on The  School&rsquo;s determination that such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, or that such processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by The School.</p>

<p>If we process your personal information for purposes of direct marketing, you may object at any time. Direct communications from The  School that are for marketing, promotional, or solicitation purposes may contain an option for unsubscribing and if so, will provide instructions for how to do so.</p>
